Clustering-Assignment
Comparative Performance Study of Different Clustering Algorithms
using different pre-processing techniques, different numbers of clusters, and different evaluation parameters.

📌 Objective
The goal of this assignment is to analyze the performance of various clustering algorithms by applying:

Different pre-processing techniques

Different numbers of clusters

And comparing them on multiple evaluation metrics

A small dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was selected for this study.

🛠️ Tasks Performed
Selected the Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Applied different preprocessing techniques like Normalization and Standardization.

Implemented clustering algorithms:

K-Means

K-Medoids

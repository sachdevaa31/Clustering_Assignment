Clustering-Assignment
Comparative Performance Study of Different Clustering Algorithms
using different pre-processing techniques, different numbers of clusters, and different evaluation parameters.

Objective
The goal of this assignment is to analyze the performance of various clustering algorithms by applying:

Different pre-processing techniques,

Different numbers of clusters,

And comparing them on multiple evaluation metrics.

A small dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was selected for this study.

Tasks Performed
Selected the Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Applied different preprocessing techniques like normalization and standardization.

Implemented clustering algorithms:

K-Means

K-Medoids

Performed cluster analysis using different numbers of clusters (e.g., 2, 3, 4).

Evaluated clusters using metrics such as:

Inertia

Silhouette Score

Visualized results using tables and graphs.

Summarized findings and concluded the best-performing approach.

Technologies Used
Python

Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook)

Libraries:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

scipy

How to Run
Open the Colab notebook (Clustering_Assignment.ipynb).

Run all cells sequentially.

Review the outputs including tables, graphs, and conclusions.

Dataset
Dataset Name: Iris Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Iris Dataset

Description:
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) categorized into three species.

Results
Tables comparing clustering performance for different preprocessing techniques.

Graphs showing cluster visualization.

Metrics like Inertia and Silhouette Score across different cluster counts.

Conclusion
A detailed conclusion is provided at the end of the notebook, identifying:

The best preprocessing technique,

The most effective clustering algorithm,

The optimal number of clusters,

And final recommendations based on experimental results.
